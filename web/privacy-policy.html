                    <p>A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you
                        agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a
                        particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web

                        find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any

                        can
                        usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from
